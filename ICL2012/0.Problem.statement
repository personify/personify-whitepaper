Problem Statement

Modern web applications such as Prismatic [1] and, Pandora[2] seek to connect users with personalized media based upon their interests. Some have said that the future of media is ubiquitous personalization [2]. Can this create potentially unintended side-effects? 
-- Does this facilitate development of so-called "echo chambers", where people are only exposed to views they are already familiar/agree with?
-- Can this lead to intellectual stagnation, bombarding one with similar messages that require little additional understanding? 
-- Can one leverage this technology, to not only to find topically related information, but to actually serve as a knowledge growth vehicle? 

In this work, we introduce Educate.me, which seeks to integrate social media information with classical student modeling[5][6] to develop a holistic model for educational sequencing.
