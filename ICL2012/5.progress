Progress & Future Work

Educate.me is a prototype application being developed as a multi-agent architectural system using Personify[]. As it is still in prototype stages, advanced relevancy ranking and content classification based on calculated author expertise and social adoption rates is still in development. Preliminary results, using a similar methodology to Prismatic and augmenting it via sequencing by reading level, have proven promising. Future work involves full implementation of socially influenced weighting of articles and integration of components enabling affective feedback such as eye-trackers[] and webcams[]. Additionally, the effect of shared media experiences can be explored.
