Progress & Future Work

educate.me is a prototype application being developed as a multi-agent architectural system using Personify,an agile multi-agent oriented-architectural framework. As it is still in prototype stages, advanced relevancy ranking and content classification based on calculated author expertise and social adoption rates is still in development. Preliminary results, using a similar methodology to Prismatic and augmentation via reading level sequencing, have proven promising. Future work involves full implementation of socially influenced weighting for articles and integration of components enabling affective feedback such as eye-trackers and webcams. Additionally, the effect of shared media experiences can be explored.
