Background

Learning systems such as educational games[1][2][3], virtual communities[4][5][6], and Intelligent Tutoring Systems[7][8][9] have long sought to provide users with computer aided instruction. These systems have been shown to be efficacious in various contexts, but have not found widespread deployment or ubiquity in modern K-12 environments. 

Modern innovations in education such as Khan Academy[10], Code Academy[11], and Mathalicious[12] approach education in the 21st century as a technologically oriented personalized experience. Concerns remain that popular software may not incorporate the findings of educational theory and cognitive science. 
Furthermore, although such software provides learners a pathway through a sequenced set of content, it has little understanding of a learner's current knowledge, cognitive load[13], or differentiated model of expertise[14]. 

Can we do better? Can we leverage the same type of personalization approach Prismatic and Pandora use to help people learn information?

Educate.me is a service that seeks to do exactly that.
