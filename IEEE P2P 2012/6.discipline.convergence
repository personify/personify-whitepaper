Convergence of Disciplines

Furthermore, the very notion of building software as P2P networks of agents opens up a new category of software architectural research. Metrics for reputation management[], trust[], security, and reliability become available as tools to describe a software architecture. Additionally, traditional software architectural notions of information hiding[], architectural views[], and patterns[] could become relevant in P2P network analysis.
