Personify: A P2P lean software architectural pattern oriented reference model for self-adaptive system

Large-scale infrastructure technology;Self-organization;P2P applications and systems over mobile networks

Self-adaptive systems are an area of active research within peer-to-peer computing, software engineering, robotics, artificial intelligence, and many other fields. The most prevalent research uses theory-heavy approaches such as extensions to Z, development of adaptation modeling tools for UML, and other traditional techniques to accomplish autonomous software adaptation. We describe Personify, a system that builds software as a P2P agent-oriented architecture. We use Personify to develop energize.me a P2P network. We show the construction of a generalizable P2P agent, an Analyst, and present it as a model for the P2P applications of the future.
