Convenience for Users

Users represented by autonomous agents on P2P networks could request their agents to handle broad goals, such as "maintain their share ratio at >=1 on average over the course of a month." These agents could then autonomously monitor user systems and begin seeding at periods of inactivity, such as when a user is away. When a user wants to perform a high bandwidth activity--such as stream a movie from an online service provider to watch in browser--the agent could understand that the user wishes to optimize bandwidth and reconfigure its download/upload policy accordingly.
